# NC News Frontend App

This is a front-end application created with React and JavaScript - it enables users to view news articles, filter them by topic, date, votes and number of comments. In addition it also allows users to vote on their favourite articles and submit new comments. \
It is hosted in-browser at: https://nc-news-jamesu.netlify.app/ \
This project works in conjunction with a backend API that I created, which is accessible at:
